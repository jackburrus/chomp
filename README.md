# 🧐 Project philosophy

Vendor's pay middlemen like Stripe, Square and Toast too much to process their payments. Chomp leverages Ethereum layer 2's to streamline the shop creation process so vendors can easily upload new menu items to a decentralized contract. The customer checkout flow is also handled by Chomp. Users can get a copy of their receipt in the form of an on-chain svg nft to demonstrate proof of purchase.
